# Movie-Recommendation-System
This code focuses on developing a movie recommendation systems based on user- movie similarities using collaborative filtering technique.
Code uses Stochastic gradient, and Alternating Least squares as optimization techniques. In order to achieve a low rmse I used several 
optimization and enhancements such as mean centering, augmentation, adding global and u,v biases, and optimum values of 
hyperparameters in the latent factor space for a fixed number of epochs.
